# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris Osborne-Powley
I'm an aspiring programmer/data scientist. 
I've been a primary teacher specialising in the primary Computing curriculum for over half a decade, and I'm now looking to take this further by moving into the tech sector.

### On my GitHub, I store projects including:
- Tasks completed for HyperionDev's Data Science bootcamp
- Solutions to coding challenges found online
- Personal hobby projects such as PyGames

### My tech stack includes:
- Python, including data handling, analysis, visualisation and prediction
- SQL (Basic)
- PowerBI (Basic) 

### I'm currently learning:
- To further develop my Python skills and use of PowerBI to analyse large datasets
- To use PyGame to explore more uses of Python
- Looking to learn and explore another programming language

# And I'm currently interested in any:
## - Entry level data scientist or analyst roles
## - Entry level Python backend or fullstack developer roles
